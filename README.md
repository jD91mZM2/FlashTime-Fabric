# FlashTime-Fabric

A port of my good old
[FlashTime](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/83n80f/flashtime_a_mod_that_makes_everything_slow_except/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
mod, to Fabric.

This is my first open source minecraft mod! When I was starting out, I
didn't see the value in open source. Then I didn't make mods in
forever, until I made the original FlashTime that sadly couldn't be
open-sourced because it was modifications done directly on Minecraft's
source code. This can be open source because it uses the Fabric mod
loader that mostly manages to avoid touching the Minecraft source
code.
